# Project 4

## Description
In this project, we will use a kernel module to solve the classic synchronization problem, the producer-consumer problem. We will utilize the kernel threads and semaphores we built in Project 3 to implement our solution. This project will provide us with interesting kernel development experience and help us understand how to solve synchronization problems in real-world operating systems.
